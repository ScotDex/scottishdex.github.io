## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions (Q&A)

### What exactly is Socket.Kill?

Basically I developed something that was filtering a bunch of kill mails, and I was bored in work one day and I thought I would do something with those, this is how this came about, the visuals are based on the alien CRT monitor design, although I will most likely get bored of that soon and change it into something different...

### How is this different from just leaving a zKillboard tab open?

Its not really, https://zkillboard.com/ does a great job of having a rich and varied choice of information, also having historical kill mails available for your review, so it is not designed to challenge that space, just a short hand tool if you want something simple and designed for rendering performance rather than rich detail.

### Why do some kills show up instantly while others take minutes?

All based on the performance of squizz's https://github.com/zKillboard/RedisQ - the stream just spits out whats next. 

### Quite a nice idea dex, how can I show my appreciation?

The container it runs off is funded by

### How does the tool calculate "Whale" status?

Anything over 1 billion loss shows up as a different colour.

### Is my character data being tracked or stored?

No, the site does have a centralized cache to improve performance (and avoids a CCP phone call) but apart from that no data is stored.

### Can I filter the stream by a specific Region or Alliance?

Not yet, I decided against it as again thats zkills thing, however if you want that feel free to let me know.

### How can I contribute to the project or report a bug?

Open an issue/request on this GitHub
